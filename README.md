[Cozy](http://cozy.io) is a platform that brings all your web services in the
same private space.  With it, your web apps and your devices can share data
easily, providing you
with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware where no one
profiles you. You install only the applications you want. You can build your
own one too.

## Installation

This app needs a manual step if it hasn't been pre-installed on the host by cozy team.
To finalize the installation, you need to open a ssh session to your host, and execute the final installation script as below :

```
cd /usr/local/cozy/apps/self-hosting/to-install
sudo chmod u+x install-debian-scripts.sh
sudo ./install-debian-scripts.sh
```
